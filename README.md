# ToDoNotesApp
First SwiftUI project that has a To Do List and notes sheet builtin for MacOS

This was my first attempt at using SwiftUI to built something. I'm proud of the resulting application and I'm happy that I've built something that I can use in my day-to-day.

- Learned to style elements using clipping shapes
